# mixed_message_kadea
It's a small program that analyzes the elements of three different tables and returns a random element in each table. For our program the user will have fun seeing if he can simultaneously find a country with its capital and its continent.
To do this we created three tables: _countries, capitals and continents._
The output will give us an element in each of these three tables
