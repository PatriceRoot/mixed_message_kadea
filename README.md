## About the work

- It's a small program that analyzes the elements of three different Arrays and returns a random element in each table.
- For our program the user will have fun seeing if he can simultaneously find a country with its capital and its continent.
- To do this we created three arrays: _countries, capitals and continents._
The output will give us an element in each of these three arrays
